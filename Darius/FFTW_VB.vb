        ''' Tells FFTW to find an optimized plan by actually computing several FFTs and measuring their execution time.

        ''' <summary>
        ''' Specifies that an out-of-place transform is allowed to overwrite its 
        ''' input array with arbitrary data; this can sometimes allow more efficient algorithms to be employed.

        DestroyInput = 1
        ''' <summary>
        ''' Rarely used. Specifies that the algorithm may not impose any unusual alignment requirements on the input/output 
        ''' arrays (i.e. no SIMD). This flag is normally not necessary, since the planner automatically detects 
        ''' misaligned arrays. The only use for this flag is if you want to use the guru interface to execute a given 
        ''' plan on a different array that may not be aligned like the original.

        ''' Specifies that an out-of-place transform must not change its input array.

        ''' This is ordinarily the default, 
        ''' except for c2r and hc2r (i.e. complex-to-real) transforms for which DestroyInput is the default. 
        ''' In the latter cases, passing PreserveInput will attempt to use algorithms that do not destroy the 
        ''' input, at the expense of worse performance; for multi-dimensional c2r transforms, however, no 
        ''' input-preserving algorithms are implemented and the planner will return null if one is requested.
        ''' </remarks>
        PreserveInput = 16
        ''' <summary>
        ''' Like Measure, but considers a wider range of algorithms and often produces a “more optimal” plan

        ''' (especially for large transforms).
        ''' </summary>
        Patient = 32
        ''' <summary>
        ''' Specifies that, instead of actual measurements of different algorithms, a simple heuristic is 
        ''' used to pick a (probably sub-optimal) plan quickly. With this flag, the input/output arrays 
        ''' are not overwritten during planning.
